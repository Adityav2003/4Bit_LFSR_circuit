# 4-Bit Linear Feedback Shift Register

A Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a sequential shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. It's often used for generating pseudorandom sequences of bits.<br/><br/>
The lfsr consists of following components:<br/>
1. **Registers**: An LFSR consists of a series of flip-flops, typically arranged in a chain. Each flip-flop holds one bit of information.<br/>
2. **Feedback**: The output of one or more of the flip-flops is connected to the input of the first flip-flop in the chain, creating a feedback loop.<br/>
3. **Clocking**: At each clock cycle, the bits in the register shift to the next flip-flop in the chain. The bit that gets shifted into the first flip-flop is determined by a linear combination of the current bits in the register.<br/>
4. **Periodicity**: LFSRs can generate sequences of bits that appear random but are deterministic. The length of the sequence before it repeats is called the period, and for an $n-bit$ LFSR, the maximum period is $2^n - 1$.<br/>

LFSRs find applications in various fields such as cryptography, error detection, digital signal processing, and even in generating test patterns for digital circuits. They're particularly useful because they're simple to implement in hardware and efficient to run in software.
